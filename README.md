# My Career

TDD Java project example for APT course

My Career is a tiny Java application, created using TDD techniques for the APT course, a course held at UniFI. With My Career the user can create and manage students' careers, in terms of the courses that students attend. 

The whole application is created following TDD principles and using Maven as build automation tool. We used Travis CI as continuous integration server; we also used SonarCloud for code quality and code coverage. This application uses a MongoDB database.

This application supports either a GUI (created using Swing) and a CLI. User can choose the UI to use at boot.

- Docker (version 19.03.6 used during development)
